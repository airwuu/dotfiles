# Installation
Presuming you're starting from a live boot with nothing yet done to your machine, you'll want to install NixOS on your machine from a **minimal installation**.

When going through the live boot installer, choose `No Desktop` when prompted on which desktop environment to choose; you will not need one for this configuration.

## Working From A Minimal Installation
### Setting Up A Network Connection &mdash; WiFi
For WiFi users, you'll also want to connect to a network if you haven't yet.
```sh
$ nmcli device wifi list
$ nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<PASSWORD>"
$ ping google.com
```

Verify that you have a connection by pinging a website. If you have successfully connected to your network, proceed with rebuilding your system.

### Adding The Git Package
Once you've successfully booted into your new installation and have logged in, install git in a temporary nix shell:
```sh
nix-shell -p git
```

Afterwards, clone this repository into the `~/.config/nixos` directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/airwuu/dotfiles.git $HOME/.config/nixos 
```

Before running the included installation script, be sure to copy the generated hardware configuration file into this repository:
```sh
sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix ./.config/nixos/hosts/desktop
```

> If you don't do this, there's a good chance that the installation will break **OR** will brick your system upon restarting.

Now you may proceed with the initial installation:
```sh
./install.sh cloud
```

The initial installation process **will** take a fair amount of time as it downloads and installs all necessary packages and dependencies.
> Expect this to take around 10 to 20 minutes on a fresh system.


### Available Host Configurations
There are two included hosts that you need to be mindful of; one for a desktop configuration and one for a laptop configuration.

While it isn't *required*, it's strongly advised that you take a look at either of them and modify them to your needs.



## Notice
**Do NOT run the installation script as an administrator.**

Doing so will cause directories to potentially be created in the wrong place.

Ths install script will likely take several minutes.

The installer will create symlinks and overwrite existing files.
> Please backup your current configs before installing.



## Current Status
Some things are, unfortunately, broken for the time being.

- Weather sometimes works and sometimes doesn't work in the dashboard drop down
- Performance tab in the dashboard does not currently update CPU or GPU temps (missing driver or package or something)



## To Do
- Implement silent booting
